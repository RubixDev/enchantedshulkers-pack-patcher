# EnchantedShulkers Pack Patcher
When using [EnchantedShulkers](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantedshulkers) with a resource pack that alters the look of Shulker Boxes and/or Ender Chests, the enchanted versions of those items and blocks will still use the vanilla texture while closed. This had to be done to fix overlapping glint effects on said blocks.

The page to patch any resource pack is available at https://enchantedshulkers.rubixdev.de
